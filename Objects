//Using objects, we can put our information and the functions that use that information in the same place. You can also think of objects as
//combinations of key-value pairs (like arrays), only their keys dont have to be numbers like 0,1, or 2:they can be strings and variables. 

var phonebookEntry = {}; //object

phonebookEntry.name = 'Oxnard Montalvo';

};

//There are two ways to create an object. Obnject literal notation and object constructor

var myObj = {
  type: 'fancy',
